# McAngular
This repo is changing the exam-app created a few months ago to use angular
This repos uses my database and you can either import my database or just convert the multchoice.json file with this command "mongoimport --db multipleChoice --collection multipleChoice --type json --file multchoice.json --jsonArray" 
This will create the database for you and you're good to go.  To add the other parts of the test simply change the 'multipleChoice' after --collection to reflect the collection of the file your are importing.
